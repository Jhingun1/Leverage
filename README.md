## Q1: Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.❓

### ❇ Ans:



#### 1. 1990 - World's first Web Browser and Web Server:


On the 25th of December in 1990 the world’s first Web Browser was developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in Switzerland on a next computer system along with the world’s first web server, when nobody knew what the internet was yet at the time.

#### 2. 1991 - Gore bill funds Mosaic:

In the December of 1991 Alan Gore helped introduce the Gore bill which provided the funding for the first mainstream browser Mosaic which was developed by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the University of Illinois and realised for unix systems in January 1993 with ports for Macintosh and Windows. This made it the first browser to start bringing the internet to the mainstream.

#### 3. 1991 - Netscape dominates and idea for new programming language formed

In 1993 after Marc Andreessen graduated he moved to California to co-found Netscape and within just a few years the Netscape Navigator Browser would control around 80% of the browser market share. Around this time Andreessen realised that browsers needed to become more dynamic, Web Designers needed some sort of glue language to make their websites more interactive, so naturally the first thing they turned to was the super trendy Java programming language from Sun Microsystems, but they quickly started to realise that idea sucked. So plan B was to recruit this guy named Brendan Eich and his job was to put the scheme programming language in the browser. But maintain a syntax that resembled Java and he needed to have that done by yesterday. So in an astonishing 10 days later the first version of this language was born.

#### 4. 1995 - Javascript name change: 

By September of 1995 it was named live script and it was shipped in the first beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 but just a few months later in December, they decided to rename it Javascript because that made it sounds like the cool lightweight cousin to the hottest programming language of the day. Javascript started making an impact on people from day one, mostly with annoying pop-up windows.

#### 5. 1995 - ACMA Standardize Javascript:

There was a company that was becoming very popular around this time and they were launching their own browser called Internet Explorer so naturally, they reverse-engineered JavaScript and their legal team gave it the name of Jscript. so in 1996, we had two almost identical languages Javascript and Jscript and with the internet growing rapidly people realized that there would be a need to standardize JavaScript. So, Netscape turned to the European computer manufacturers or ACMA which has served as a neutral party since 1961 for setting standards in the IT industry. And by June of 1997 we had the first version of ECMA script as it's commonly known and this gave browser vendors and server-side applications a consistent spec or set of guidelines for implementing the JavaScript language.

## Q2:Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
  - packets
  - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
  - routers and routing
  - domains and DNS

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.❓
 
  
### ❇ Ans:

#### * packets:
A packet is a fixed size unit of data, a particular type of packet is usually defined to hold a certain amount of information and no more. Normally on the internet when you exchange data between computers you break things up to a bunch of different packets of information with varying size depending on the network you’re using.
[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoDuyW4pZmo&t=115s)

#### * IP addresses: 
IP addresses are used to uniquely represent where your device is the internet and are needed to send requests to devices outside of your own network.  A request contains your local machine IP address and the IP address from where it can get and send data. 

[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_-qWlvQQtY)

#### * Routers and routing
A Router is a hardware device that helps connect your devices with the internet. It's job is find the most efficient and safest path to send and recieve information. It is usually the first line of security to protect people from external attacks from hackers

[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVrYEPHexB4)

#### * Domains and DNS 
Whenever a user uses a search engine and types in a url, the Domain Name System helps direct their traffic to the unique identifying address that tells the search engine what content to request

## Q3: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
  - TCP
  - HTTP and HTTPS
  - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet ❓: 

#### * TCP:
Transmission control protocol (TCP) is an acronym for Transmission Control Protocol. It establishes a link between the host machine and the destination server via the port number, ensuring packet delivery security. It is one of the most important protocols in the Internet Protocol Suite because it ensures that data is in the correct order and that none is missing. Which ensures that contact between the customer and the service provider is of high quality.
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)

#### * HTTP AND HTTPS
The Hypertext Transmission Protocol, or HTTP, is an application protocol for transferring data over the Internet. In addition, HTTP clarifies how data is formatted and transmitted. It also specifies what action a browser should take when it receives data. HTTP is not secure, while HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Safe, is secure. It safeguards the data's integrity and privacy during transmission.
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)

#### * web browsers:
A web browser is a program that allows us to access content on the Internet, such as webpages, photos, videos, and other files. When we type a domain address to get details, it retrieves the requested content from the internet in the requested format and displays it. It can run both client and server side code.

 ## Q4:Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.❓
 ❇ Three Data structures Used in Ruby Programming are:
  - **Array**: An Array can store a list of values in a collection. It can store a variety of items in different orders. The most useful feature of an array is the ability to retrieve an element by referencing its position. Another useful action of an array is to add a new element to a position or to overwrite a new element.
  ***info link*** ➡️ [Array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55l-aZ7_F24)
  - **Hash**: A useful form of object storage and security, in which values are signed to keys which make them hard to read and safe for looking up when dealing with passwords or other sensitive information. One of the most common uses of hashes is to look up a value using the key. The '.merge' method can be used to merge two hashes, and the value can be retrieved later using the '.fetch' method.
   ***info link*** ➡️ [Hash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BldESGZKB8)
  - **Binary trees**: A Ruby binary tree is a high-level data structure that contains two child nodes, each of which can contain references to their parents.

 ## Q5:  Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.❓
### ❇ Ans:

When a device runs any code that isn’t machine code, it needs a compiler or an interpreter as a “middle layer” to translate the higher level abstracted language commands to machine code that the device can understand and execute.

An Interpreter will take the code and interpret it into machine code step by step, without much involvement of the engineer. This process usually interprets every command one at a time, which makes it marginally slower. If the engineer makes any mistakes, the interpreter tells them the errors in their code until it is written correctly.

On the other hand, the Compiler will take all the code, and will compile all of it once.
This makes it very fast, but if the engineer didn’t review his code and it was filled with errors, the compiler isn’t going to be able to help him. So compilers make it possible to expose massive security flaws or errors in production.

This is the exact way the interpreter and the compiler work on the computer.
#### Interpreter:
The Interpreter is a middle layer that takes its time interpreting code, and allows you to correct any errors by monitoring the result. The interpreter sits between your software and the hardware at all times. Line by line, it interprets everything in your high level abstracted language to machine code.
#### Compiler:
The compiler is a middle layer that takes a long time to compile the code all at once, but then runs very quickly after that. The compiler gathers all of your code and converts it. It is usually used in Java or C.

 ## Q6:  TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.❓
 ### ❇ Ans:
 
 TWO commonly used programming languages:
1.  Javascript
2.  Ruby
 
Javascript - 

Benefits:
 Popularity - JavaScript is everywhere on the Web and even serverside with Node.js
 Interoperability - JavaScript can be used in many different kinds of applications because of support in other languages like Pearl and PHP.
 Speed - Major browsers all support JIT (just in time) compilation for JavaScript, meaning that there's no need to compile the code before running it.
Drawbacks:
 Client-Side Security - Since JavaScript code is executed on the client-side, bugs and oversights can sometimes be exploited for malicious purposes. Because of this, some people choose to disable JavaScript entirely.
 Browser Support - While server-side scripts always produce the same output, different browsers sometimes interpret JavaScript code differently. These days the differences are minimal, and you shouldn't have to worry about it as long as you test your script in all major browsers.
 
Ruby -

Benefits:
 Extensive ecosystem - When compared to other frameworks, the ecosystem of Ruby on Rails makes it superior.
 Developer experience - Ruby's core philosophy is to intuitively make it easier to learn and use it
Drawbacks:
 Documentation - Documentation is challenging to seek out with Ruby on Rails framework. This problem is ever-present as only a few developers manage to document everything.
 Loosing popularity - Ruby's popularity is declining due to a decline in the popularity of Ruby on Rail which is heavily attributed to Node.js, go and Java

 ## Q7: Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.

List of topics containing ethical issues:
  - access to a user’s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs)
  - intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement.
  - criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism
  - GPS tracking data and other types of metadata, MAC addresses, hardware fingerprints
  - freedom of thought, conscience, speech and the media
  - aggressive sales and marketing practices designed to mislead and deceive consumers
  - trading of shares on the stock exchange OR crypto-currencies

For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way.

Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches.❓
 ### ❇ Ans:

 ## Q8:Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language❓
### ❇ Ans:

Ruby makes use of conditionals and loops to manage control flow. Conditionals aid in the execution of code in response to a given condition. Conditionals and loops alter the flow of a Ruby program. Conditionals are keywords that execute a certain statement under a specific condition. Loops are blocks of program that are executed multiple times. When the program is run, the statements are executed from the top of the source file to the bottom. One by one.

 ## Q9:  Explain type coercion❓
 ### ❇ Ans:
 
Type coercion is a programming technique for converting one object to another one. This is commonly used when a data type has to be changed in order to perform a calculation or manipulation. For example, if the price of various things is saved as a string on Amazon, we must first convert the price to a number before performing any mathematical operations on it. To convert a string to a number in Ruby, use 'to i' or use 'to s' to convert numbers to strings. Other data form conversion methods in Ruby include 'to f,' 'to a,' and 'to h.'
