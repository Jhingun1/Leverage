1. Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.
On the 25th of December in 1990 the world’s first Web Browser was developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in Switzerland on a next computer system along with the world’s first web server, but the biggest problem was that nobody knew what the internet was yet at the time. 

In the December of 1991 Alan Gore helped introduce the Gore bill which provided the funding for the first mainstream browser Mosaic which was developed by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the University of Illinois and realised for unix systems in January 1993 with ports for Macintosh and Windows. This made it the first browser to start bringing the internet to the mainstream.

In 1993 after Marc Andreessen graduated he moved to California to co-found Netscape and within just a few years the Netscape Navigator Browser would control around 80% of the browser market share.

Around this time Andreessen realised that browsers needed to become more dynamic, Web Designers needed some sort of glue language to make their websites more interactive, so naturally the first thing they turned to was the super trendy Java programming language from Sun Microsystems, but they quickly started to realise that idea sucked.

So plan B was to recruit this guy named Brendan Eich and his job was to put the scheme programming language in the browser. But maintain a syntax that resembled Java and he needed to have that done by yesterday. So in an astonishing 10 days later the first version of Javascript was born. 

Around this time, it's not even called JavaScript yet, but Mocha and by September of 1995 it was renamed to live script and it was shipped in the first beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 but just a few months later in December, they decided to rename it Javascript because that made it sounds like the cool lightweight cousin to the hottest programming language of the day. Javascript started making an impact on people from day one,  mostly with annoying pop-up windows. 

There was a company that was becoming very popular around this time and they were launching their own browser called Internet Explorer so naturally they reverse engineered JavaScript and their legal team gives it a name of Jscript so in 1996 we have two almost identical languages Javascript and Jscript and with the internet growing rapidly people realized that there would be a need to standardize JavaScript so Netscape turned to the European computer manufacturers association or ACMA which has served as a neutral party since 1961 for setting standards in the IT industry. Which was the first standardized version of Javascript..
